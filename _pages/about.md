I'm a PhD Student at the <a href='https://www.utfpr.edu.br/cursos/coordenacoes/stricto-sensu/cpgei/'>Postgraduate Program in Electrical Engineering and Industrial Informatics (CPGEI)</a> at the <a href='https://www.utfpr.edu.br/'>Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR)</a>. I won a prestigious doctoral scholarship from the <a href='https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br'>National Council for Scientific and Technological Development</a>.

During the doctorate, I spent two months (Guest Visiting Researcher Program - UNICAMP) as a visiting researcher at the <a href='https://hiaac.unicamp.br/en/'>Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures Hub (H.IAAC)</a> at the <a href=' Institute of Computing - UNICAMP'> Institute of Computing - UNICAMP</a>.

I'm also a lectioner at the <a href='https://www.unisenaipr.com.br/'>National Industrial Learning Service in the State of Paraná (SENAI)</a>.

Before joining CPGEI and SENAI, I earned a BS in Computer Engineering (2012) and an MS in Applied Computing (2020), both from the UTFPR.

My research interests are:

<ul>
	<li>Urban Computing</li>
	<li>Data Mining</li>
	<li>Social Networks Analysis</li>
	<li>Applied Data Science</li>
	<li>Machine Learning</li>	
</ul>

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
