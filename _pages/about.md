I'm a PhD Candidate at the <a href='https://www.utfpr.edu.br/cursos/coordenacoes/stricto-sensu/cpgei/'>Postgraduate Program in Electrical Engineering and Industrial Informatics (CPGEI)</a> at the <a href='https://www.utfpr.edu.br/'>Federal Technological University of Paran치 (UTFPR)</a>. I won a prestigious doctoral scholarship from the <a href='https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br'>National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil</a>.

During the doctorate, I spent two months (Guest Visiting Researcher Program - UNICAMP) as a visiting researcher at the <a href='https://hiaac.unicamp.br/en/'>Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures Hub (H.IAAC)</a> at the <a href=' Institute of Computing - UNICAMP'> Institute of Computing - UNICAMP</a>.

I'm also a lectioner at the <a href='https://www.unisenaipr.com.br/'>National Industrial Learning Service in the State of Paran치 (SENAI)</a>.

Before joining CPGEI and SENAI, I earned a BS in Computer Engineering (2012) and an MS in Applied Computing (2020), both from the UTFPR.

My research interests are:

<ul>
	<li>Urban Computing</li>
	<li>Data Mining</li>
	<li>Social Networks Analysis</li>
	<li>Applied Data Science</li>
	<li>Machine Learning</li>	
</ul>
